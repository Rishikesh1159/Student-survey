 This project focuses on server side processing of the Student Survey Form data via
MVC implementation using a RequestDispatcher object. The implementation required to
implement one Servlet that acts as a front controller that receives all client requests, saves the
form data to a database table, performs business logic(s) via business delegate classes, stores
JavaBean objects into a session or request object, and then forwards the request to appropriate
JSP to present the data to the user. The assignment required all business logic code into separate
Java class(es) which could be called from within the servlet to perform specific tasks. All
presentation logic is moved to JSP pages.
